How are they dealing with this uncertainty and stress? Wondering what can you do to help support your employees during this difficult time? Many employers already offer a benefit \u2013 an Employee Assistance Program (or EAP) \u2013 that can help employees more effectively balance personal and work-life demands but often it is unknown to the workforce and underutilized. Individuals can even access it free, and commonly it is provided at no cost to the company.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Services Commonly Offered in Employee Assistance Programs<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>An International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans survey reported these services were offered by their Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs):<\/p>\n<div class=\"table-1\">\n<table width=\"100%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Services Offered in Employee Assistance Programs<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Referral Support<\/td>\n<td>89.1%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mental Health Assistance\/Counseling<\/td>\n<td>88.0%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Substance Abuse Assistance\/Counseling<\/td>\n<td>85.9%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Financial Assistance\/Counseling<\/td>\n<td>83.7%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Crisis Hotline<\/td>\n<td>82.6%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Legal Assistance<\/td>\n<td>79.3%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Family\/Dependent Assistance\/Counseling<\/td>\n<td>77.2%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Access Available for Family Members<\/td>\n<td>76.1%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Caregiving Assistance (for child\/senior)<\/td>\n<td>68.5%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Trauma Response (workplace crisis)<\/td>\n<td>65.2%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Violence Prevention Services\/Support<\/td>\n<td>57.6%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Disaster Recovery Services\/support<\/td>\n<td>55.4%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Onsite Speakers<\/td>\n<td>47.8%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Job\/Career Counseling<\/td>\n<td>38.0%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Veterans Assistance<\/td>\n<td>35.9%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Training Programs\/Professional Development<\/td>\n<td>32.6%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<\/div>\n<p>Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) provide a wide range of services and support for employees as well as their families. During these unusual times, this can become a much more valuable benefit. Employees can get help in dealing with specific issues, such as depression, anxiety, grief, stress, insomnia, isolation, childcare and virtual schooling, elder care issues, financial challenges, legal matters, housing concerns, and workplace strategies. The impact of stress at this time may directly affect more of your employees than the health risks of COVID-19.<\/p>\n<p>Typically, EAPs provide a few free sessions with counselors who provide guidance on the issue of concern and usually have online resources available 24\/7. You should actively promote this benefit and encourage your employees to seek out these resources, which can be just as valuable as their health plan.<\/p>\n<p>Not only can the EAP directly help employees and their families, but it can also provide additional support to management, such as guidance on handling personnel issues, virtual training opportunities, and other articles, tips or resources which should be promoted to their workforce during these trying times.<\/p>\n<p>Your EAP probably offers ideas for ways to communicate it. Now, most employees are working remotely. So, remember to include promotions in company-wide emails, discussions during virtual meetings, and information and links on the organization\u2019s intranet. And managers should be well versed in your EAP benefits so that they can recommend it to their teams, as needed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Author:<\/strong> <a
